          One practical problem if everyone born never dies
          and if people keep making babies
          then earth's population will rapidly
          outstrip the resources to support it.
          So the day we stop dying must also be
          the day we find another orb to
          accommodate our overproduction of
          air-breathing humans.
          This need for extra planets will never
          cease.
          But the universe is vast,
          and just in our small sector of the
          galaxy the catalogs are now rising
          through 5 000 known exoplanets.
          We just need to invent terraforming
          technologies in either <strong>Warp Drives</strong>  or
          <strong>Wormhole</strong> transportation systems,
          and all will be fine.
          </p>
          <p class="para-2" style = "text-indent:2cm;">
          But why do we long to live forever?
          we want to live forever because we fear
          death.
          We fear death because we are born
          knowing only life.
          Yet we don't fear having never been born.
          While it's surely better to be alive
          than dead,
          it's even better to be alive at all than
          to not ever exist.
          Religion through the ages has offered
          detailed accounts for what happens after
          death.
          For some it includes what happened
          before you were born,
          a basic tenet of reincarnation.
          Science doesn't have much to say about
          Valhalla or Elysium
          or Hades or Heaven or Hell or the
          spirits of your ancestors.
          The methods and tools of science do
          however make cold concrete statements
          about what happens when you die.
          Upon death there is no evidence that you
          experience the consciousness you enjoyed
          while alive.</p>
          <p class="para-3" style = "text-indent:2cm;">
          The electrochemical source of all your
          thoughts, feelings and sensory awareness
          of the universe,
          your <strong>Brain</strong>.
          Which normally lights up an MRI,
          becomes starved of oxygen. We know that's
          you disappearing because people who
          experience a series of ultimately fatal
          strokes
          tragically and systematically lose
          function of their mind and body
          as they descend into a state of
          non-existence.
          That's not as odd as it sounds!
          Were you conscious before you were
          conceived?
          did you complain? where am I?
          how come I'm not on Earth?
          No.
          You simply didn't exist,
          and if you're lucky to be born,
          your non-existence before life
          bookends your non-existence after death.
          </p>
          <p class="para-4" style = "text-indent:2cm;">
          Consider that humans
          are typically conceived in the single
          most intimate act of human affection.
          We then gestate in utero for nine months,
          suckle for another 12 months
          and require continual care through our
          toddler years.
          Afterward
          humans attend elementary school to learn
          reading writing and arithmetic.
          In middle school and high school we also
          learned biology chemistry
          maybe physics.
          We read works of literature
          we learn history and the arts might even
          play sports.
          Lifelong friendships germinate from
          these activities.
          We may also learn languages spoken by
          other humans around the world.
          We participate in all the seasonal
          rituals that we retain in modern society
          as a binding force that brings us
          together.
          Adulthood arrives.
          21 years go by.
          At a speed of 30 kilometers per second
          Earth completed 21 orbits around the Sun.
          A total of 20 billion kilometers through
          space.
          All along,
          humans,
          invent refine and perfect anti-personnel
          weapons such as land mines, assault
          rifles, missiles and bombs.
          Any one of which can end a life in an
          instant.
          Wars have taken a staggering and tragic
          toll on human life since
          pre-civilization.
          Yet even excluding organized armed
          conflict humans find reasons to murder
          other humans at a rate that exceeds 400,
          000 per year.
          Yes,
          worldwide humans commit homicide more
          than a thousand times per day.
          </p>
          <p class="para-5" style = "text-indent:2cm;">
          Do you know?
          do you really know
          how precious life is?
          The total number of people who have ever
          been born is about 100 billion,
          yet the genetic code that generates
          viable versions of us is capable of at
          least 10 to the 30th variations that
          astronomically huge number is a 1
          followed by 30 zeros (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000)
          providing a million trillion
          trillion possible souls.
          Run through them all and eventually we
          end up with you again or at least your
          twin.
          But that won't happen anytime soon.
          So far our branch of the tree of life
          has produced no more than 0.00000000000000001%
          of all possible humans.
          Forcing the conclusion,
          that most people who could ever exist
          will never even be conceived,
          each of us,
          for all practical purposes is unique in
          the universe,
          NOW and FOREVER.
          </p>
          <p class="para-6" style = "text-indent:2cm;">
          Being alive is the time to celebrate.
          Being alive
          every waking moment.
          All along the way
          why not strive to make the world a
          better place today than yesterday?
          Simply for the privileged of having
          lived in it.
          On my deathbed I'd be sad to miss the
          clever inventions and discoveries that
          arise from our collective human
          ingenuity.
          Presuming the systems that foster such
          advances remain intact.
          That's what fueled the exponential
          growth of science and technology in my
          lifetime.
          I'd further wonder whether
          civilization's arc of social progress
          will continue.
          With all its fits and starts
          and thus reward any time traveler from
          the oppressed spectrum of humanity who
          chose to visit the future
          rather than the past.
          </p>
          <p class="para-7" style = "text-indent:2cm;">
          On the whole I don't fear death.
          Instead I fear a life where I could have
          accomplished more.
          An epitaph worthy of a tombstone
          comes from the 19th century educator
          Horace Mann, 
          “I beseech you to treasure up in your
          Hearts”
          these my parting words.
          Be ashamed to die
          until you have won some victory for
          humanity.
          Our primal urge to keep looking up
          is surely greater than our primal urge
          to keep killing one another.
          If so then human curiosity and wonder
          the twin chariots of cosmic discovery
          will ensure that starry messages
          continue to arrive.
          These insights compel us for our short
          time on earth
          to become better shepherds of our own
          civilization.
          Yes life is better than death,
          life is also better than having never
          been born.
          But each of us is alive against
          stupendous odds.
          We won the lottery
          only once.
          We get to invoke our faculties of reason
          to figure out how the world works.
          We also get to smell the flowers
          We get to bask in divine sunsets and
          sunrises.
          And gaze deeply into the night skies
          they cradle.
          We get to live
          and ultimately die
          in this glorious <span style="color: red;">UNIVERSE</span>.
