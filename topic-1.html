        <p class="para-1" style = "text-indent:2cm;">It is not that pseudoscience and superstition and new age so called beliefs
        and fundamentalist zealotry are something new.
        They've been with us for as long as we've been human.
        But we live in an age based on science and technology
        with formidable technological powers.
        Science and technology are propelling us forward at accelerating rates,
        and if we don't understand it
        by we I mean the general public
        if it's something that - "Oh, I'm not good at that. I don't know anything about it".
        Then who is making all the decisions about science and technology
        that are going to determine what kind of future our children live in?</p> <br>
        <p class="midtitle-1">"Danger of Science"</p> <br>
        <p class="para-2" style = "text-indent:2cm;">What's the danger of all this?..
        It is two kinds of things. One is what I just talked about
        that we've arranged the society based on science and technology
        in which nobody understands anything about science and technology.
        And this combustable mixture of ignorance and power
        sooner or later is gonna blow up in our faces.
        And the second reason that I'm worried about this is that
        science is more than a body of knowledge.
        It's a way of thinking.
        A way of skeptically interrogating the universe
        with a fine understanding of the human fallability.
        If we are not able to ask skeptical questions to interrogate those who tell us
        that something is true. To be skeptical of those in authority
        then we are up for grabs for the next charlatan
        political or religious, who comes ambling along.
        It is a thing that Jefferson <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson">(Thomas Jefferson)</a>  laid great stress on.
        It wasn't enough he said to inshrine some rights in a constitution or bill of rights.
        The people had to be educated
        and they have to practice their skepticism and their education.
        Otherwise we don't run the government.
        The government runs us.</p> <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 2cm;" class="para-3">You see, people read stock market quotations and financial pages.
        Look how complex that is.
        People are able to look at sports statistics.
        Look how many people can do that.
        Understanding science is not more difficult than that.
        It doesn't involve greater intellectual activities.
        But the thing about science is first of all
        it's after what the universe really is and not what makes us feel better.
        And a lot of the competing doctrines
        are after what feels good.
        And not what, what's... True.</p> <br>
        <p class="midtitle-2">"Science does not prove religion, because religion is faith-based"</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2cm;" class="para-4">Let's look a little more deeply into that.
        What is faith?
        It is believe in the absence of evidence.
        Now, I don't propose to tell anybody what to believe, but for me
        believing when there is no compelling evidence
        is a mistake.
        The idea is to withhold believe until there is compelling evidence.
        And if the universe does not comply with our predispositions
        Okay, then we have the wrenching obligation to accommodate to the way the universe is.
        So who is more humble?
        The scientist who looks at the universe with an open mind and accepts whatever the universe has to teach us?
        Or somebody who says everything in this book must be considered the literal truth
        and never mind the fallibility of all the human beings involved in the writing of this book?</p> <br>
        <p style="text-indent: 2cm;" class="para-5">[Carl's Parents]
        I lost both my parents about 12 and 15 years ago
        I had a great relationship with them
        I really miss them.
        I would love to believe they are spirits who are around somewhere.
        And I'd give almost anything to spend five minutes a year with them.
        ["Do you hear their voices ever?" - interviewer asked],
        Sometimes, about six or eight times since their death I have heard.
        'Carl!'...
        just in the voice of my father or my mother.
        Now, I don't think that it means that they are in the next room.
        I think it means that I've had an auditory hallucination about it.
        I was with them so long. I heard their voices so often.
        Why shouldn't I be able to make a vivid recollection.</p>
        <p class="para-6"><strong class="inter-seg">Interviewer: </strong> "This is what is interesting about this for me. 
        You convinced me long time ago that it was arrogant for me or anyone else
        to believe there wasn't life outside of our..." </p>
        <p class="para-6"><strong class="carl-seg">Carl: </strong> "To exclude the possibility" </p>
        <p class="para-6"><strong class="inter-seg">Interviewer: </strong> "to exclude the possibility, was an arrogance of intellect that we should not exclude.
        You couldn't prove. You didn't know it was there. But the arrogance..."</p>
        <p class="para-6"><strong class="carl-seg">Carl: </strong> "Wait, we don't know if He is there
        We don't know if He is not there.
        Let's look!"</p>
        <p class="para-6"><strong class="inter-seg">Interviewer: </strong> "And if you take that, why can't you say there is alot we don't know?"</p>
        <p class="para-6"><strong class="carl-seg">Carl: </strong> "I say that.
        Here watch, there is a lot that we don't know.
        That's what I believe. But that does not mean that every fraudulent claim has to be accepted.
        We demand the most rigorous standards of evidence
        especially on what is important to us.
        So if some guy comes up to me
        a channeller or a medium: 'I can put you in touch with your parents'.
        Well because I want so terribly to believe that
        I know I have to need to reach in for added reserves of skepticism
        because I'm likely to be fooled
        and much more minor, to have my money taken."</p>
        <p class="para-6"><strong class="inter-seg">Interviewer: </strong> "You are living with myelodysplasia"</p>
        <p class="para-6"><strong class="carl-seg">Carl: </strong> "Or I have been"</p>
        <p class="para-6"><strong class="inter-seg">Interviewer: </strong> "And just share with us because of your sense of language
        and sense of understanding and being afflicted in perspective
        what do you think about it and what does it do for you to?"" </p>
        <p class="para-6"><strong class="carl-seg">Carl: </strong> "I didn't have any near death experiences. I didn't have a religious conversion."</p>
        <p class="para-6"><strong class="inter-seg">Interviewer: </strong> "But you thought about what it would be like to die".</p>
        <p class="para-6"><strong class="carl-seg">Carl: </strong> "Certainly and what it would be like for my family.
        And in what I think about what it would be like for me
        because I don't think it is likely that there is anything you think about after you're dead.<br>
        A long dreamless sleep.
        I'd love to believe the opposite but I don't have any evidence.
        But one thing that it has done is
        to enhance my sense of appreciation for the beauty of life
        and of the universe and the sheer joy of being alive".<br>
        Every moment
        every inanimate object
        And to say nothing about the exquisite complexity of living beings.
        You imagine missing it all and suddenly it is so much more <span class="precious">PRECIOUS</span>".
