          You never know what's gonna cause the next great discovery to be made.
          Is it a Eureka moment in the middle of the night? is it some small small ink
          consistency in a measurement that you made? Isaac Asimov famously noted that the
          greatest discoveries in the history of the world weren't somebody burning the midnight oil saying “Eureka!”. It was
          somebody looking at some data and saying “that's odd?”. So consider that in the late
          1800s classical physics was riding high. What does classical physics? It's Newton
          it's it's its electricity its magnetism it's all of these sort of basic laws of
          physics that were established basically between the 1600s and the 1800s.
          Definitely before the Quantum and before Relativity and all these exotic
          theories of the universe that defy every bit of common sense you could possibly bring to bear. So there's some well-known
          scientists at the end of the 1800s and they were sure that there were no more
          major discoveries to take place in the field and that physics would soon end.
          They were just a few messy clouds on the horizon that some better research would
          resolve which leads to they don't these differ from each other do the experiment
          again a few times and that'll all come out just fine.

        <p class="para-2" style = "text-indent:2cm;">
          Coming out of the 1800s
          however, those small clouds turned to be more like
          sort of chinks in the armor of classical physics. Which eventually opened a door
          into a century of mind-blowing modern physics that transformed the world. Not
          only the world in physics but geopolitics as well. It's the simple
          introduction of <span style="color: red;">E = mc<sup>2</sup></span>  as the foundation of all our nuclear
          arsenals how they generate energy. So small things that don't quite work. Some
          of them get resolved with better data others don't. They lead to deep and new
          understandings of the universe and so in that spirit I bring to you a story,
          something we call the <strong>“Pioneer Anomaly”</strong>. There are two spacecraft pioneer 10 and
          11 they were launched in 1972 in 1973 and they were destined to take a tour of
          the planets and escape the solar system altogether. And the way you do that is because we don't have our rockets aren't
          big enough to give it that much energy. So they launch and they swing behind they come in behind a planet and they
          fall towards it and the orbit of the planet catches on to the to the space
          probe and then you do a sort of a gravitational slingshot flinging it forward with extra energy. When you do
          that for a couple of planets you can have enough energy to have those space probe probes escape the solar system
          altogether. They were the first-ever pieces of hardware to achieve this feat.
          Because of this fact we had a fixed on their sides a famous plaque of
          Pictograms.

          It showed among other things an unclothed male and female human form
          and the male you may remember this from from the day and the male had an arm
          raised presumably a sign of peace that assumes that this is a sign of peace to aliens of course. But on this plaque
          there's a map that showed where the craft came from which is essentially the return address of the solar system in
          the galaxy and not only that it showed some other basic scientific insights.
          That we've gleaned as a species. So all of this is in case the aliens from
          another star system found the craft, it would allow them to learn basic facts about our species. There
          was a comic shortly after the spacecraft did their thing and they were well publicized there was a comic and it
          showed aliens who had captured come upon the pioneer
          craft and they're looking at this picture that we sent on the side of the craft and these aliens are dressed in
          tuxedos by the way and one alien turns to the other and says “they're just like us except they don't wear clothes” stupid
          comic but I'd never forget it. But anyway, these plaques represented the first-ever
          attempt to communicate with another species using pictograms and hardware
          that they might come upon. Now here they
          are on their way out of the solar system. We expect them to slow down we know
          they're going to escape but whatever speed they have we expect them to slow
          down as they climb out of the Sun's gravitational embrace. Now since they
          have enough energy to escape entirely they'll slow down but never slow down to zero okay that's fine. Here's the problem,
          the actual deceleration we measure is
          greater for each craft then what we calculate it should be after accounting
          for all the possible forces that could slow down the craft. That is the Pioneer
          anomaly. The effect is small but it's
          persistent and every attempt to understand its cause has failed. The
          effect became measurable about eight years into the journey but it was not studied in detail until about 1994 and
          we haven't communicated with the pioneer craft since 2003 they're too far away now for signals to be exchanged. But we
          have data over a 23-year period from nineteen from 1980 right on up through
          night through 2003 and that baseline of data continues to be studied.

          In our future 
          we will collide with Andromeda after our son dies after the Sun around which
          we orbit expands to become a red giant and engulfs the orbit of the earth rendering us a charred ember soon to
          become vaporized. So we need to find a way to move to another planet or another
          star system to watch this happen. But then when we watch it happen if a star comes too close you can have a flyby
          looting of the planets that belong to one star gets
          stolen by another because stars will be flying back and forth. So it'll be an
          exciting time for Earth when that happens or it'll be a sight an exciting
          time for any civilizations alive to watch it. What we don't know is whether
          earth will survive that will we be among those flung into intergalactic space?
          Will we fall towards the SuperDuper massive black hole that now occupies its
          Center? Or we will we find a <span style="color: red;">new home</span> around a new star that is perhaps just
          born giving us a new lease on life for the apocalyptic civilization that ours.
